**Evening**

**When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them.**
 
There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? -- What hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. All is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
 
Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. -- I will pour water upon him that is thirsty. -- Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
 
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.

**Evening**

**Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.**
 
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.
 
Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. -- There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one LORD, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. -- When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven.
 
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way ... let us draw near.  

**Eph 2:18; John 17:23; John 14:13,14,16,17; Eph 4:4-6; Luke 11:2; Heb 10:19,20,22**

**Jehovah‑nissi: The Lord my banner.**
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
 
Behold, God himself is with us for our captain. -- The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
 
These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. -- Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

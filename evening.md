**Evening**

**His name shall be called Counsellor.**
 
The Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the LORD. And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD.
 
Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. O ye simple, understand wisdom: and ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
 
The LORD of hosts ... is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working. -- If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. -- Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

**Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?**
 
I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. -- O Lord, thou art our father, we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. -- It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good. Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments.
 
He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. -- Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. -- It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. -- Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.
 
Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

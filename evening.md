**Evening**

**The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.**
 
He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her ... And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last. Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
 
To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. -- If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
 
All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
 
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

**He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.**
 
Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD.
 
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. -- I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. -- I have whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. -- My heart rejoiceth in the LORD. ... I rejoice in thy salvation.
 
Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

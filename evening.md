**The spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.**
 
Jesus ... lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, ... Holy Father, ... O righteous Father. -- He said, Abba, Father. -- Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. -- For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God.
 
Doubtless thou art our father, ... thou, O Lord, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.
 
I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father. Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children.

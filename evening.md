**Evening**

**I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life.**
 
For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.
 
If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin but now they have no cloke for their sin. That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
 
The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him. -- Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
 
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.

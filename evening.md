**Evening**

**By nature the children of wrath, even as others.**
 
We ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. -- Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
 
Job answered the LORD, and said, Behold, I am vile: what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. -- The LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
 
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. -- David ... to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.
 
I obtained mercy, ... who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.
 
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

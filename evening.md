**Evening**

**Awake, O north wind, and ... blow upon my garden, that the the spices thereof may flow out.**
 
No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. -- The fruit of the Spirit.
 
He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
 
Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
 
Though [Jesus] were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the the things which he suffered. -- In all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  

**Song 4:16; Heb 12:11; Gal 5:22; Isa 27:8; Psa 103:13; 2 Cor 4:16; Heb 5:8; Heb 4:15**

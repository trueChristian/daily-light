<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?</strong>
 
Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. -- I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
 
Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.
 
Ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. -- Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you. -- Ye ... are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
 
The heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

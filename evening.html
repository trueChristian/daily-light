<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Our bodies washed with pure water.</strong>
 
Thou shalt ... make a laver of brass, ... and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; ... they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not. -- Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you. -- If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
 
In my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. -- There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth. -- Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity. -- I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

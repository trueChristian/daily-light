<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>It is God which worketh in you.</strong>
 
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God. -- A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. -- No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. -- And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever.
 
Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
 
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
 
LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.

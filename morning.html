<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</strong>
 
When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. -- Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
 
Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may he able to stand against the wiles of the devil. -- And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. -- Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. -- Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. -- This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
 
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.

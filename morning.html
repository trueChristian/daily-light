<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</strong>
 
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.
 
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
 
When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul: discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee.
 
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. -- I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. -- If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind,... I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</strong>
 
Father, I will that they ... whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. -- He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.
 
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. -- Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus.

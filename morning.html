<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.</strong>
 
Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
 
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. -- Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. -- Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. -- Thy word hath quickened me.
 
The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

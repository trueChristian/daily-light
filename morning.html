<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.</strong>
 
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? -- Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. -- To love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
 
Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. -- Mary ... sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. One thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
 
It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

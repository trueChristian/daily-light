# Morning

**He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world.**
 
That we should be holy and without blame before him in love.
 
God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto he called you, ... to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. -- Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
 
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. -- God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.  

**Eph 1:4; Eph 1:4; 2 Thes 2:13,14; Rom 8:29,30; 1 Pet 1:2; Eze 36:26; 1 Thes 4:7**

# Evening

**If the Lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be?**
 
Have faith in God. -- Without faith it is impossible to please God. -- With God all things are possible.
 
Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver?
 
My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. -- Prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
 
Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear. -- LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many or with them that have no power.
 
We should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.  

**2 Kgs 7:2; Mark 11:22; Heb 11:6; Matt 19:26; Isa 50:2; Isa 55:8,9; Mal 3:10; Isa 59:1; 2 Chr 14:11; 2 Cor 1:9**

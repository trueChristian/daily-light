# Morning

**Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.**
 
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
 
I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. -- Having therefore, ... boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. -- We may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.  

**Heb 4:16; Phl 4:6,7; Rom 8:15; Isa 45:19; Heb 10:19,22; Heb 13:6**

# Evening

**Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.**
 
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. -- The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. -- If the Son ... shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
 
Brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. -- Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
 
Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. -- Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.  

**John 8:32; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:2; John 8:36; Gal 4:31; Gal 2:16; Jas 1:25; Gal 5:1**

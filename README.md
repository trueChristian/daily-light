# Morning

**Make his praise glorious.**
 
This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. -- I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth. -- By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
 
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. -- Who is like unto thee, O LORD, ... glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. -- They sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.  

**Psa 66:2; Isa 43:21; Jer 33:8,9; Heb 13:15; Psa 86:12,13; Exo 15:11; Psa 69:30; Rev 15:3**

# Evening

**By nature the children of wrath, even as others.**
 
We ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. -- Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
 
Job answered the LORD, and said, Behold, I am vile: what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. -- The LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
 
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. -- David ... to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.
 
I obtained mercy, ... who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.
 
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

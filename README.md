# Morning

**Think upon me, my God, for good.**
 
Thus saith the Lord; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness. -- I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. -- I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you. -- For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
 
As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. -- I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number. -- Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered.  

**Neh 5:19; Jer 2:2; Ezek 16:60; Jer 29:10; Jer 29:11; Isa 55:9; Job 5:8,9; Psa 40:5**

# Evening

**I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.**
 
There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass. -- God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
 
The Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him. -- He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
 
Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.
 
The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.  

**Josh 1:5; Josh 21:45; Num 23:19; Deut 7:9; Psa 111:5; Isa 49:15,16; Zeph 3:17**

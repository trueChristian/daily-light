# Morning

**The Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.**
 
Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come. -- The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
 
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. -- Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
 
The Comforter ... even the Spirit of truth. -- The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace. -- The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
 
My presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest. And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us?  

**2 Thes 3:16; Rev 1:4; Phl 4:7; Luke 24:36; John 14:27; John 15:26; Gal 5:22; Rom 8:16; Exo 33:14-16**

# Evening

**We glory in tribulations.**
 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
 
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- Sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.
 
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, rejoice. -- They departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
 
The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.
 
Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.  

**Rom 5:3; 1 Cor 15:19; 1 Pet 4:12,13; 2 Cor 6:10; Phl 4:4; Acts 5:41; Rom 15:13; Hab 3:17,18**

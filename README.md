# Morning

**Be strong, and work; for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts.**
 
I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. -- I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. -- Strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. -- The joy of the Lord is your strength.
 
Thus said the Lord of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets. -- Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. -- The Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might.
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

# Evening

**The darkness hideth not from thee.**
 
His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. -- Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? ... Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.
 
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; ... nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ... Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. -- He that keepeth thee will not slumber. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.  

**Psa 139:12; Job 34:21,2; Jer 23:24; Psa 91:5,6,9,10; Psa 121:3,5; Psa 23:4**

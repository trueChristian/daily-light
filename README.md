# Morning

**Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.**
 
To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. -- All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. -- By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. -- Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
 
I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.

# Evening

**Who redeemeth thy life from destruction.**
 
Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name. -- I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.
 
As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
 
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
 
Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. -- When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.  

**Psa 103:4; Jer 50:34; Hos 13:14; Heb 2:14,15; John 3:36; Col 3:3,4; 2 Thes 1:10**

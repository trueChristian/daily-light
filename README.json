      "It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. -- Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.",
      "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.",
      "Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. -- Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord."

      "Abstain from all appearance of evil. -- Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. -- For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.",
      "But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.",
      "Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. -- Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. -- Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. -- Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

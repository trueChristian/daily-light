O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? -- Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. -- For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them. Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.",

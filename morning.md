**Morning**

**Whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.**
 
LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. -- He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. -- His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
 
Your life is hid with Christ in God. -- He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. -- Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. -- God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear.
 
Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. -- Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

**Morning**

**Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.**
 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
 
A continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. -- In all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
 
Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
 
The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
 
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit. -- Pray without ceasing.

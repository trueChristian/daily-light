**Morning**

**Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.**
 
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. -- Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. -- I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. I made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments. -- Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
 
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. -- We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins. -- Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is say, his flesh: and having a high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

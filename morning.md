**Morning**

**The Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.**
 
Truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is a heavenly. Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. -- The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. -- No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
 
God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. -- Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
 
He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

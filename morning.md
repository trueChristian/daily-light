**Morning**

**The fruit of the Spirit is longsuffering, gentleness**.
 
The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.
 
Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love. -- Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. -- Charity suffereth long, and is kind.
 
In due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
